                <div>
                    <p>A top-down 2D puzzle adventure game with stealth elements that was built in Unity for an Advanced Game Design course at Simon Fraser University. The player plays as three animals (parrot, monkey, dog), stacked on top of each other in a trench coat, who accidently joins a spy organization. They must solve puzzles while hiding their identities.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>In the environmental design, I focused on ensuring that players knew where to go, what was interactable, and what the points of interests were. This was important as many of our puzzle clues were either embedded into the environment or required the player to investigate specific areas in the map. For example in Figure 1,  the tank is investigated for a clue relating to the kelp in the tank.

                    </figure>

                    <p>To do this, I made points of interests “pop out” of the environment more through the use of bright colours, like the paintings in Figure 2 & 3, or through placing interesting objects, like the desk with papers.</p>

                <h2>Playtesting and Iteration</h2>
            </div>

            <div>
                <p>We conducted playtesting sessions where we received feedback where one of the puzzles in level 3 was too difficult and that the visual hint (the image on the divider) was too small to make out its details. Also, the difficulty of the word related puzzles decreased going from level 3 to 4 instead of either remaining the same or increasing.</p>

                <p>
                    To resolve the issues I changed the imagery in the divider, as seen below, so the visuals are clearer to
                    the player through its connection to the text hint as the previous text hints did not mention the drawn
                    animals. The divider decreased to 2 columns so the player could make out their details better. In
                    addition, the shelf also got lowered so it wouldn’t block the image.</p>

                <figure class="comparison-img">

                    <figcaption>Figure 2. Before and after the divider imagery change.</figcaption>
                </figure>


                <p>Level 3’s text hints were based on predator-prey relationships but the text hints didn’t relate to the
                    divider image very well so they were reworded to involve the animals on the divider because players were unable to figure out the theme of this puzzle. It was also told to the
                    player more explicitly that the password referred to predator and prey instead of relying on pure
                    imagery.</p>
                <p>
                    Level 4’s puzzle was reworded from telling the player a number to hiding the number within a sentence to
                    improve our difficulty ramping.</p>

            <div>
                <p>Through working on this project, I’ve improved my skills in level design and environmental art. As this was the first time I’ve created environments, I’ve learned more about the process of designing intuitive levels.</p>

                <p>I’ve learned the importance of playtesting throughout each stage of the project. With each session, I am able to make modifications earlier, preventing the problem of having to create larger changes down the line. Also, I’ve improved my level design skills through iterative testing, identifying areas of concern and finding ways to resolve them.</p>

                <p>In the future, I would incorporate more narrative elements into the background as it mostly contains necessary devices to proceed through the game. Adding more life into the maps would help deliver background information as well as increase player engagement. </p>
